    <div class="mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research investigates how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) understand, reason over, and interact with geospatial information. Maps are a core medium through which humans communicate about the world, yet today’s AI systems still struggle to interpret spatial relationships, resolve geographic context, or answer questions requiring multi-hop reasoning grounded in place. To address these limitations, I develop evaluation frameworks, benchmarks, and analysis methods that reveal where current models succeed, fail, and why.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        I am particularly focused on improving models’ capability for structured spatial reasoning — such as inferring topological relationships, navigating map symbols, and integrating multimodal context — and on designing new techniques that enhance their geographic literacy and reliability on real-world decision tasks. My work spans geospatial AI, machine learning evaluation, multimodal understanding, and human-centered concerns around accessibility and representation in AI systems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Ultimately, I aim to bridge the gap between powerful general-purpose foundation models and the critical domain knowledge required to operate safely and equitably in map-based and location-aware applications.
        <!-- My research focuses on groundbreaking investigations into radioactivity and the discovery of new radioactive elements. Through meticulous experimental techniques and innovative methodologies, I aim to advance our understanding of radioactive phenomena and their applications in both physics and chemistry. -->
