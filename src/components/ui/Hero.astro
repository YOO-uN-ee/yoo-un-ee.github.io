    I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">University of Minnesota–Twin Cities</a>, where I am a member of the <a href="https://knowledge-computing.github.io/" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">Knowledge Computing Lab</a> advised by <a href="https://yaoyichi.github.io/" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang</a>.

    My research focuses on advancing the understanding of how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) process geospatial information.
    I am especially interested in the capabilities and limitations of these models in performing geospatial reasoning tasks, such as interpreting topological relationships, recognizing spatial features, and engaging in multi-hop reasoning over map content.
    My current work involves developing benchmarks and evaluation methods to assess LVLM map-reasoning abilities, and exploring techniques to enhance their spatial understanding and reliability on domain-specific tasks.
    Beyond my current work, I am also interested about linguistic variations, including regional terminology differences and cultural influences on data and model interpretation.

    I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota and both my B.Eng and M.Eng in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://cooper.edu/" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">The Cooper Union</a>. 
    My Master's thesis, <a href="https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/detection-replacement-neologisms-translation/docview/2811800738/se-2" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">Detection and Replacement of Neologisms for Translation</a>, supervised by <a href="https://engfac.cooper.edu/sable2" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">Dr. Carl Sable</a>, explored methods for identifying newly coined terms to improve machine translation quality. 
    Additionally, I worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://lvl.ru.is/" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">Language and Voice Lab</a> at Reykjavik University with <a href="https://staff.ru.is/stefanola/" class="hover:text-accent text-secondary">Dr. Stefán Ólafsson</a>, where I helped evaluate multilingual language models and their effectiveness for lower-resourced languages.
